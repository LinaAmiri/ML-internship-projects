# Task 3: Feed-Forward Neural Network – Churn Prediction

This project implements a **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)** using TensorFlow/Keras to predict **customer churn**. The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Churn dataset** provided by the internship.
- Split into:
  - **Train:** 80%
  - **Test:** 20%
- Features: 20 (after preprocessing)
- Target: Binary (Churn vs Not Churn)

---

## ⚙️ Implementation
- Framework: **TensorFlow / Keras**
- Steps:
  1. Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, splitting).
  2. Building a sequential **Feed-Forward Neural Network**.
  3. Training with validation split.
  4. Evaluation on test set.
  5. Metrics + visualization.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
- Input Layer: 20 features  
- Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation  
- Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation  

---

## 📊 Results
- **Final Test Accuracy:** ~ **88.9%**
- **Classification Report:** Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Confusion Matrix:** Correct vs incorrect predictions
- **Training Curves:** Accuracy and Loss plots over epochs
