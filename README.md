# Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains **3 projects** developed during my Machine Learning internship.  
Each task explores a different ML approach, dataset, and methodology.  

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 🔹 Task 1: Random Forest Classifier (Churn Prediction)
- Implemented a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict customer churn.  
- Dataset: Telecom churn dataset.  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.  
- Visualizations include confusion matrix and feature importance ranking.  

**Key results:**  
- Accuracy: ~85%  
- Insights into which features contribute most to churn prediction.

### 🔹 Task 2: Support Vector Machine (Iris Dataset Classification)
- Built a **Support Vector Machine binary classifier** on the classic **Iris dataset**.  
- Compared **Linear** and **RBF kernels**.  
- Visualized decision boundaries for both kernels.  

**Key results:**  
- SVM with **RBF kernel** achieved better separation of classes compared to linear.  
- Demonstrated kernel choice impact on classification performance.

### 🔹 Task 3: Feed-Forward Neural Network (Churn Prediction)
- Implemented a **Feed-Forward Neural Network** using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Dataset: Customer churn dataset (80/20 split).  
- Evaluated using classification report, confusion matrix, and training curves.  

**Key results:**  
- Test Accuracy: **88.9%**  
- Neural network successfully captured nonlinear patterns in the data.
